\title{calculate entropy of an optionally discrete value (X) using a histogram approach using the following method}
\usage{
calculateEntropy_Grassberger(df, groupVars, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{- may be grouped, in which case the grouping is interpreted as different types of discrete variable}

\item{groupVars}{- the columns of the discrete value quoted by the vars() function (e.g. ggplot facet_wrap)}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing the disctinct values of the groups of df, and for each group an entropy value (H). If df was not grouped this will be a single entry

For our purposes we fix l=0 to give the form in eqn 27. The error in this method is supposedly better for undersampled cases (where number of bins.
