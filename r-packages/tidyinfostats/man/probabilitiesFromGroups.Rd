\title{Helper function to calculate probability from grouped data in a tidy friendly manner}
\usage{
probabilitiesFromGroups(df, groupXVar, groupYVar, countVar = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing 2 columns defining class of event X and class of event Y and either one row per event, 
or a count of observations, for each class combination. 
df may also be grouped and in which case the grouping is preserved in the result.}

\item{groupXVar}{the datatable column defining the class of event Y}

\item{countVar}{the datatable column containing the observed frequency combination of event XY. If this is missing the row count will be used instead}
}
\value{
A new datatable with all possible combinations of X&Y and the probabilities associated with each outcome (i.e. an N(X) by N(Y) set of binary confusion matrices)
}
\description{
The purpose of this is to calculate the probabilities of all binary outcomes from class data. 
This function is useful when you have 2 types of events (X and Y) and
you either have a set of observations of their co-occurrence, containing non-unique X & Y combinations, or you have a confusion matrix of the counts of their combinations where 
each row has a unique combination of X and Y and a third column contains the counts of XY co-occurrences.
