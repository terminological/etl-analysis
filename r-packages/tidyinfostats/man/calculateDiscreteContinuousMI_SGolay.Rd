\title{calculate mutual information between a categorical value (X) and a continuous value (Y)}
\usage{
calculateDiscreteContinuousMI_SGolay(df, groupXVar, valueYVar, k_05 = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{- may be grouped, in which case the value is interpreted as different types of continuous variable}

\item{groupXVar}{- the column of the categorical value (X)}

\item{valueYVar}{- the column of the continuous value (Y)}

\item{k_05}{- the half window width of the SG filter that smooths the data. This is dependent on data but typically not less that 10.}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing the disctinct values of the groups of df, and for each group a mutual information column (I). If df was not grouped this will be a single entry
